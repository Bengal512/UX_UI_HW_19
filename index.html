        <h1>Ben Galang</h1>
        <p>Hello.  I am a designer who loves to do research.  I strive to create thoughtful, user centric, and impactful user experiences.  I was once a Quality Assurance Analyst for thirteen years, so I know a lot about software testing, how a user thinks, have a creative mindset with the ability to approach a problem creatively.  I am easy to work with and have excellent analytical skills.  Building upon these skills have helped me become a better User Experience Designer.  I look forward to seeing, hearing and talking to you about your project.  </p>

       <H3>User Research</H3>
         <p> I enjoy discovering user's needs, expectations and motivation because I feel that this helps shape the direction of the design and what the users will find pleasing when they are using the application.

            <p> Some of my best ideas come from great collaboration with my teammates.  I have worked with many groups and I have always had an impact on the team because I listen to their ideas and provide constructive feedback on their design thinking with my input and use that towards creating a better solution for our product.

              I enjoy working with people who I know are better than I am design wise so I am always learning and improving my skills as a UX Designer.
